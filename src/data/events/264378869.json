{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Labor Day - Cherry St Coffee and Downtown Hike (PIONEER SQUARE) ","url":"https://www.meetup.com/seattle-coffee-club/events/264378869/","description":"We will start at the flagship Cherry St location in Pioneer Square (not the Public House). Look for us on the 2nd floor.\n\nAfter 45-60 minutes, the plan is to hike to Belltown and back along the Viaduct near the Marina. Let us get one last look at the Viaduct before it is completely taken down. The hike portion of this Meetup is optional. I estimate it will be 3.5 miles round trip.\n\nROASTER: Counter Culture\n\nPARKING: Labor Day is a Seattle Parking holiday\nhttp://www.seattle.gov/transportation/pro","startDate":"2019-09-02T12:30-07:00","endDate":"2019-09-02T15:30-07:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Cherry Street Coffee House","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"700 1st Ave","addressLocality":"Seattle","postalCode":"98104","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"USA"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":47.602752685546875,"longitude":-122.33421325683594}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","price":"0","priceCurrency":"USD"},"organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Coffee Club of Seattle","url":"https://www.meetup.com/seattle-coffee-club/"}}
